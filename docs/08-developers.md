$GLOBALS['TL_HOOKS'][\Codefog\EventsSubscriptions\EventDispatcher::EVENT_ON_EXPORT][] = ['MyClass', 'onExport'];
```

### onSubscribe

The event is triggered when the member is subscribed to the event. The argument passed on is the instance
of the `Codefog\EventsSubscriptions\Event\SubscribeEvent` object.

```php
$GLOBALS['TL_HOOKS'][\Codefog\EventsSubscriptions\EventDispatcher::EVENT_ON_SUBSCRIBE][] = ['MyClass', 'onSubscribe'];
```

### onUnsubscribe

The event is triggered when the member is unsubscribed from the event. The argument passed on is the instance
of the `Codefog\EventsSubscriptions\Event\UnsubscribeEvent` object.
